    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to present the results to a stakeholder and give recommendations about where he could find his dream house. In the first part EDA/statistical analysis will be used to get some information about the data. In the second part, several recommendations which meet the interests of your stakeholder will be presented. This will be mainly done with an already filtered dataset meeting the stakeholder's interest and using geographical maps. \n",

    "The King County Housing Data dataset contains information about home sales in King County (USA).\n",
    "In this project the stakeholder 'Jacob Phillips' was chosen. He wants to buy a house in the Kind County area. He has unlimited budget, wants 4+ bathrooms or smaller house nearby, big lot (tennis court & pool), golf, historic and no waterfront.  \n",
